## **Project Highlights**
- **Data Integration:** Combines seismic data with well logs using depth-matching algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts seismic attributes (amplitude, frequency, phase) and engineered features for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Models for predicting porosity, permeability, and temperature gradients.
- **Prediction Pipeline:** Predicts properties for unknown wells using seismic data and trained models.
- **Visualization:** Depth-wise property plots for validation and insights.
